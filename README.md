# Football Analysis

This project aims to detect and track players, referees, and footballs in video footage using the YOLO object detection model. It includes team assignment based on t-shirt colors using Kmeans clustering, movement analysis with optical flow, and perspective transformation to measure player movements accurately.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze football matches by detecting and tracking players, referees, and footballs. It uses YOLO for object detection, Kmeans for team assignment, optical flow for camera movement analysis, and perspective transformation for accurate measurement of player movements.

## Features

- **YOLO**: Detect players, referees, and footballs.
- **Kmeans**: Assign players to teams based on t-shirt colors.
- **Optical Flow**: Measure camera movement between frames.
- **Perspective Transformation**: Measure player movements in meters.
- **Movement Analysis**: Calculate player speed and distance covered.

## Usage

Run the scripts to perform various analyses:

1. **Detection and Tracking**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/detect_and_track.py --input videos/sample_input.mp4 --output results/output.mp4
    ```
2. **Team Assignment**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/team_assignment.py --input videos/sample_input.mp4 --output results/team_output.mp4
    ```
3. **Movement Analysis**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/movement_analysis.py --input videos/sample_input.mp4 --output results/movement_output.mp4
    ```
